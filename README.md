# My vim config file, with a bunch of plugins managed by vundle

## Using the config:
1. First you'll have to install [vundle] (https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) as your plugin manager. Follow their quick guide to get up and running
2. After go ahead and clone this repo to your .vim folder
3. Open up a vim instance and do :PluginInstall
4. Thats it you're all set, edit any specifics you'd like on vim_config and add plugins to vimrc
+ *optional* You can run :PluginUpdate to update plugins every once in a while

Enjoy!
